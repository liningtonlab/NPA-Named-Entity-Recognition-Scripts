Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, and electronic circular dichroism calculations. A biogenetic pathway for 1 and 2 is proposed. Both 1 and 2 showed no significant antibacterial activity or cytotoxicity at 50 Î¼M.', ['Aspterpenacid A', 'Aspterpenacid B']),
                   ('test_range_2', 'Three novel monomeric naphtho-\u03b3-pyrones, peninaphones A-C (compounds 1-3), along with two known bis-naphtho-\u03b3-pyrones (compounds 4 and 5) were isolated from mangrove rhizosphere soil-derived fungus Penicillium sp. HK1-22. The absolute configurations of compounds 1 and 2 were determined by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra, and the structure of compound 3 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Compounds 4 and 5 are a pair of hindered rotation isomers. A hypothetical biosynthetic pathway for the isolated monomeric and dimeric naphtho-\u03b3-pyrones is also discussed in this study. Compounds 1-3 showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 43300, 33591, 29213, and 25923) with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values in the range of 12.5-50 \u03bcg/mL. Compound 3 exhibited significant activity against the rice sheath blight pathogen Rhizoctonia solani.', ['Peninaphone A', 'Peninaphone B', 'Peninaphone C'])]
