      "abstract": "By feeding various amino acids to the marine fungus Scedosporium apiospermum F41-1, 22 diverse alkaloids, including 14 new compounds, were obtained. Scedapins A-E (1-5) possess a rare skeleton of a pyrazinoquinazolinedione and an imidazoindolone/indolone linked by a tetrahydrofuran ring. Scedapin C (3) is the first example of fumiquinazoline that contains an aminosulfonyl group. Their structures were determined by HRMS, NMR, ECD calculations and X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis. The biosynthetic pathways of fumiquinazolines 1-18 were proposed. Scedapin C (3) and scequinadoline D (8) displayed significant antiviral activity against hepatitis C.",

      "title": "Production of \u03b1-galactosylceramide by a prominent member of the human gut microbiota.",
      "abstract": "While the human gut microbiota are suspected to produce diffusible small molecules that modulate host signaling pathways, few of these molecules have been identified. Species of Bacteroides and their relatives, which often comprise >50% of the gut community, are unusual among bacteria in that their membrane is rich in sphingolipids, a class of signaling molecules that play a key role in inducing apoptosis and modulating the host immune response. Although known for more than three decades, the full repertoire of Bacteroides sphingolipids has not been defined. Here, we use a combination of genetics and chemistry to identify the sphingolipids produced by Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343. We constructed a deletion mutant of BF2461, a putative serine palmitoyltransferase whose yeast homolog catalyzes the committed step in sphingolipid biosynthesis. We show that the \u03942461 mutant is sphingolipid deficient, enabling us to purify and solve the structures of three alkaline-stable lipids present in the wild-type strain but absent from the mutant. The first compound was the known sphingolipid ceramide phosphorylethanolamine, and the second was its corresponding dihydroceramide base. Unexpectedly, the third compound was the glycosphingolipid \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer(Bf)), which is structurally related to a sponge-derived sphingolipid (\u03b1-GalCer, KRN7000) that is the prototypical agonist of CD1d-restricted natural killer T (iNKT) cells. We demonstrate that \u03b1-GalCer(Bf) has similar immunological properties to KRN7000: it binds to CD1d and activates both mouse and human iNKT cells both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our study reveals BF2461 as the first known member of the Bacteroides sphingolipid pathway, and it indicates that the committed steps of the Bacteroides and eukaryotic sphingolipid pathways are identical. Moreover, our data suggest that some Bacteroides sphingolipids might influence host immune homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "Excessive uric acid production, which causes gout and hyperuricemia, can be blocked by inhibiting xanthine oxidase (XO). However, some agents to block on XO often cause side effects, thereby necessitating the identification of new inhibitors. During the screening of XO inhibitors from various mushroom extracts, we found that a methanolic extract of the fruiting bodies of Tyromyces fissilis, an inedible and non-toxic fungus, showed inhibitory activity. Both n-hexane and ethyl acetate layers, obtained by partitioning this extract exhibited XO inhibitory activity. Subsequently, using an activity-guided separation method, eight active compounds (1-8) were isolated. The structures of five of the new compounds, 2-4,\u00a06, and 7, were elucidated by spectral analysis and chemical derivatization. All compounds had a salicylic acid moiety with an aliphatic group at the C-6 position. Notably, 2-hydroxy-6-pentadecylbenzoic acid (1) showed the highest level of XO noncompetitive inhibition (58.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2% at 25\u00a0\u00b5M).",

      "abstract": "Cinnamoyl-containing nonribosomal peptides (CCNPs) are a small group of secondary metabolites with potent biological activities produced by actinobacteria. Two remarkable features in the biosynthesis of CCNPs include the nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs) for assembly of the depsipeptide backbone and the type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) for N-terminal cinnamoyl moiety construction. Here, we present a genome mining approach targeting both NRPS and type II PKS for discovery of new CCNPs, which led to the identification of 51 putative CCNP gene clusters from public bacterial genome databases. After strain prioritization, a novel class of CCNP-type glycopeptides named kitacinnamycins, one of which showing potent activation ability towards the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein, was identified. Bioinformatic, genetic and biochemical analysis revealed the use of the NRPS assembly line to form the macrocyclic peptide backbone, followed by a P450 monooxygenase to generate terminal oxidized groups. A glycosyltransferase with relatively broad substrate specificity transfers sugars to the newly generated OH/COOH group. The protein crystallographic study further provided structural insights into this glycosylation. Our results not only demonstrated the feasibility of genome mining and strain prioritization for the discovery of new bioactive natural products but also disclosed the biosynthetic pathway for kitacinnamycins.",

      "abstract": "Microbes sense and respond to their environment with small molecules, and discovering these molecules and identifying their functions informs chemistry, biology, and medicine. As part of a study of molecular exchanges between termite-associated actinobacteria and pathogenic fungi, we uncovered a remarkable fungal metabolite, homodimericin A, which is strongly upregulated by the bacterial metabolite bafilomycin C1. Homodimericin A is a hexacyclic polyketide with a carbon backbone containing eight contiguous stereogenic carbons in a C20 hexacyclic core. Only half of its carbon atoms have an attached hydrogen, which presented a significant challenge for NMR-based structural analysis. In spite of its microbial production and rich stereochemistry, homodimericin A occurs naturally as a racemic mixture. A plausible nonenzymatic reaction cascade leading from two identical achiral monomers to homodimericin A is presented, and homodimericin A's formation by this path, a six-electron oxidation, could be a response to oxidative stress triggered by bafilomycin C1.",

This paper describes the structure elucidation of the products of the cryptic and silent PKS19 gene cluster that were recently identified (fujikurins A-D). We present the complete NMR data for the structure elucidation of the main compound fujikurin D, which shows tautomeric 1,3-diketo elements. The different tautomeric structures could be confirmed using quantum chemical calculations. Additionally, the structures of the minor compounds fujikurins A-C were elucidated by high-resolution mass spectrometric fragmentation experiments. It emerged that fujikurin A was identical to the bioactive compound CR377 of the taxonomically unclassified Fusarium strain CR377, while fujikurins B-D have not been reported from other fungi.",

      "abstract": "Three new 3-amino-6-hydroxy-2-piperidone (Ahp)-containing cyclic depsipeptides, named loggerpeptins A-C (1-3), along with molassamide (4), were discovered from a marine cyanobacterium, extending the structural diversity of this prevalent scaffold of cyanobacterial serine protease inhibitors. Molassamide, which contains a 2-amino-butenoic (Abu) unit in the cyclic core, was the most potent and selective analogue against human neutrophil elastase (HNE). Given the growing evidence supporting the role of HNE in breast cancer progression and metastasis, we assessed the cellular effects of compounds 3 and 4 in the context of targeting invasive breast cancer. Both compounds inhibited cleavage of the elastase substrate CD40 in biochemical assays; however, only 4 exhibited significant cellular activity. As CD40 and other receptor proteolytic processing culminates in NF\u03baB activation, we assessed the effects of 4 on the expression of target genes, including ICAM-1. ICAM-1 is also a direct target of elastase and, in our studies, compound 4 attenuated both elastase-induced ICAM-1 gene expression and ICAM-1 proteolytic processing by elastase, revealing a potential dual effect on migration through modulation of gene expression and proteolytic processing. Molassamide also specifically inhibited the elastase-mediated migration of highly invasive triple-negative breast cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "Antrodia cinnamomea, a medicinal fungus indigenous to Taiwan, has been shown to exhibit a broad spectrum of bioactivities for the treatments of alcoholic intoxication, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fatigue, and a number of active principles have been identified. Among the bioactive entities, clinical trials of antroquinonol and 4-acetyl antroquinonol B are being carried out for curing cancer, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia. The total synthesis of antroquinonol has been achieved; however, investigating the structure-activity relationship of this class of compounds remained difficult due to the lack of available analogues. Twenty antroquinonols isolated from A.\u00a0cinnamomea IFS006 are reported herein. Their structures were elucidated using spectral analysis and by comparison with literature values. Of these, 11 antroquinonol analogues, namely, antroquinonols N-X (1-11), were previously unreported. The growth inhibitory activity of all the antroquinonol analogues was evaluated against human A549 and PC-3 cancer cell lines, and antroquinonol A exhibited the most potent activity, with GI50 values of 5.7 \u00b1 0.2 and 13.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM, respectively. Antroquinonols V (9) and W (10) also showed growth inhibitory activity against A549 cells with GI50 values of 8.2 \u00b1 0.8 and 7.1 \u00b1 2.1 \u03bcM, respectively, compared to 5-fluorouracil (GI50 = 4.2 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM).",

      "abstract": "In a whole-cell mechanism of action (MOA)-based screening strategy for discovery of antifungal agents, Candida albicans was used, followed by testing of active extracts in the C. albicans fitness test (CaFT), which provides insight into the mechanism of action. A fermentation extract of an undescribed species of Metulocladosporiella that inhibited proteasome activity in a C. albicans fitness test was identified. The chemical genomic profile of the extract contained hypersensitivity of heterozygous deletion strains (strains that had one of the genes of the diploid genes knocked down) of genes represented by multiple subunits of the 25S proteasome. Two structurally related peptide aldehydes, named fellutamides C and D, were isolated from the extract. Fellutamides were active against C. albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus with MICs ranging from 4 to 16 \u03bcg/mL and against fungal proteasome (IC\u2085\u2080 0.2 \u03bcg/mL). Both compounds showed proteasome activity against human tumor cell lines, potently inhibiting the growth of PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells, but not A549 lung carcinoma cells. In PC-3 cells compound treatment produced a G2M cell cycle block and induced apoptosis. Preliminary SAR studies indicated that the aldehyde group is critical for the antifungal activity and that the two hydroxy groups are quantitatively important for potency.",

This antifeedant activity may be a reflection of the secondary metabolite content, known to be comprised of many serine protease inhibitors. Further chemical and NMR spectroscopic investigation led us to isolate and structurally characterize a new serine protease inhibitor 1 that is formally derived from an intramolecular condensation of largamide D (2). The cyclization resulted in diminished activity, but to different extents against two serine proteases tested. This finding suggests that cyanobacteria can endogenously modulate the activity of their protease inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are a source of chemically diverse metabolites with potential medicinal and biotechnological applications. Rapid identification of compounds is central to expedite the natural product discovery process. Mass spectrometry has been shown to be an important tool for dereplication of complex natural product samples. In addition, chromatographic separation and complementary spectroscopic analysis (e.g., UV) can enhance the confidence of the dereplication process. Here, we applied a droplet-liquid microjunction-surface sampling probe (droplet probe) coupled with UPLC-PDA-HRMS-MS/MS to identify two new natural products in situ from the freshwater strain Calothrix sp. UIC 10520. This allowed us to prioritize this strain for chemical investigation based on the presence of new metabolites very early in our discovery process, saving both time and resources. Subsequently, calothrixamides A (1) and B (2) were isolated from large-scale cultures, and the structures were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The absolute configurations were determined by a combination of chemical degradation reactions, derivatization methods (Mosher's, Marfey's, and phenylglycine methyl ester), and J-based configurational analysis. Calothrixamides showed no cytotoxic activity against the MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, and OVCAR3 cancer cell lines. They represent the first functionalized long-chain fatty acid amides reported from the Calothrix genus and from a freshwater cyanobacterium.",

      "title": "Self-resistance guided genome mining uncovers new topoisomerase inhibitors from myxobacteria.",
      "abstract": "There is astounding discrepancy between the genome-inscribed production capacity and the set of known secondary metabolite classes from many microorganisms as detected under laboratory cultivation conditions. Genome-mining techniques are meant to fill this gap, but in order to favor discovery of structurally novel as well as bioactive compounds it is crucial to amend genomics-based strategies with selective filtering principles. In this study, we followed a self-resistance guided approach aiming at the discovery of inhibitors of topoisomerase, known as valid target in both cancer and antibiotic therapy. A common host self-defense mechanism against such inhibitors in bacteria is mediated by so-called pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRP). Genes encoding the biosynthetic machinery for production of an alleged topoisomerase inhibitor were found on the basis of their collocation adjacent to a predicted PRP in the genome of the myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax An d48, but to date no matching compound has been reported from this bacterium. Activation of this peculiar polyketide synthase type-II gene cluster in the native host as well as its heterologous expression led to the structure elucidation of new natural products that were named pyxidicyclines and provided an insight into their biosynthesis. Subsequent topoisomerase inhibition assays showed strong affinity to - and inhibition of - unwinding topoisomerases such as E. coli topoisomerase IV and human topoisomerase I by pyxidicyclines as well as precise selectivity, since E. coli topoisomerase II (gyrase) was not inhibited at concentrations up to 50 \u03bcg ml-1.",

Compounds 1 and 2 could significantly inhibit the radicle growth of dicotyledon weeds, Eclipta prostrata and Veronica persica, at a concentration range from 50 to 200 \u00ce\u00bcg mL-1, while 3 notably stimulated radicle growth at the same concentration range.

      "title": "Indole Diterpenoids from an Endophytic Penicillium sp.",
      "abstract": "A chemical investigation of the endophyte Penicillium sp. (strain ZO-R1-1), isolated from roots of the medicinal plant Zingiber officinale, yielded nine new indole diterpenoids (1-9), together with 13 known congeners (10-22). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR analysis in combination with HRESIMS data. The absolute configuration of the new natural products 1, 3, and 7 was determined using the TDDFT-ECD approach and confirmed for 1 by single-crystal X-ray determination through anomalous dispersion. The isolated compounds were tested for cytotoxicity against L5178Y, A2780, J82, and HEK-293 cell lines. Compound 1 was the most active metabolite toward L5178Y cells, with an IC50 value of 3.6 \u03bcM, and an IC50 against A2780 cells of 8.7 \u03bcM. Interestingly, 1 features a new type of indole diterpenoid scaffold with a rare 6/5/6/6/6/6/5 heterocyclic system bearing an aromatic ring C, which is suggested to be important for the cytotoxic activity of this natural product against L5278Y and A2780 cells.",

A subset of these cryptic genetic elements appears as individual operons. Here we investigate potential single-operon biosynthetic systems found in the genome of the pathogenic bacterium  Burkholderia pseudomallei . Placing these operons under the control of an inducible promoter led to the production of seven new metabolites. Among the molecules we identified are inhibitors of type-4 phosphodiesterases, suggesting that previously cryptic biosynthetic operons may encode metabolites that could contribute to microbial virulence by disrupting host signaling pathways.",

This strain allowed us to discover a novel compound that we designate aspercryptin and to propose a biosynthetic pathway for the compound. Interestingly, aspercryptin is formed from compounds produced by two separate gene clusters, one of which makes the well-known product cichorine. This raises the exciting possibility that fungi use differential regulation of expression of secondary metabolite gene clusters to increase the diversity of metabolites they produce.",

Three species of cultured marine cyanobacteria, Moorea producens 3L, Moorea producens JHB, and Moorea bouillonii PNG, were subjected to genome sequencing and analysis for their recognizable biosynthetic pathways, and this information was then compared with their respective metabolomes as detected by MS profiling. By genome analysis, a presumed regulatory domain was identified upstream of several previously described biosynthetic gene clusters in two of these cyanobacteria, M. producens 3L and M. producens JHB. A similar regulatory domain was identified in the M. bouillonii PNG genome, and a corresponding downstream biosynthetic gene cluster was located and carefully analyzed. Subsequently, MS-based molecular networking identified a series of candidate products, and these were isolated and their structures rigorously established. On the basis of their distinctive acyl amide structure, the most prevalent metabolite was evaluated for cannabinomimetic properties and found to be moderate affinity ligands for CB1.",

The absolute configurations of 1-6, representing the central and axial chirality elements or preferred helicities, were established by a combination of X-ray diffraction analysis, chemical conversions, and TDDFT-ECD calculations. The interconversion of different biaryl linkages between 1 and 4 and between 2 and 3 in DMSO by a retro-oxa-Michael mechanism provided insight into the formation of the xanthone-chromanone dimers and supported the assignments of their absolute configurations. Compounds 1-6 exhibited cytotoxicities against the seven tested cancer cell lines, with the best IC50 value of 0.7 \u03bcM. Compound 5 showed further inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I.",

      "title": "Phytotoxic Activity of Metabolites Isolated from Rutstroemia sp.n., the Causal Agent of Bleach Blonde Syndrome on Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum).",
      "abstract": "A fungal pathogen soon to be described as Rutstroemia capillus-albis (Rutstroemiaceae, Helotiales, Leotiomycetes) has been identified as the causal agent of 'bleach blonde syndrome' on the invasive annual grass weed Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) in western North America. This apparently common but previously undescribed disease causes premature senescence and sterility, but does not affect seed germination or seedling emergence and growth. This study investigated whether the new species produces phytotoxins that could be implicated in pathogenesis. The compounds 9-O-methylfusarubin, 9-O-methylbostrycoidin, 5-O-methylnectriafurone, trans-methyl-p-coumarate and terpestacin were isolated from the solid culture of this fungus. The undescribed absolute stereochemistry at C-3 of 9-O-methylfusarubin and at C-1' of 5-O-methylnectriafurone were assigned by applying electronic and vibrational circular dichroism (ECD and VCD) combined with computational methods and the advanced Mosher's method, respectively. The first three listed compounds are naphtoquinone pigments, while terpestacin is a sesterterpene, and trans-methyl-p-coumarate could be the product of an unusual fungal phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. In a juvenile plant immersion bioassay, both 9-O-methylfusarubin and terpestacin proved to be highly toxic at 10-4 M, causing wilting and plant death within 10 days. This finding suggests that these two compounds could play a role in pathogenesis on B. tectorum.",

      "abstract": "Bioassay-guided fractionation of a methanolic extract of the fungus Arthrinium sp., isolated from the Mediterranean sponge Geodia cydonium, afforded 10 natural products including five new diterpenoids, arthrinins A-D (1-4) and myrocin D (5). In addition, five known compounds were obtained, which included myrocin A (6), norlichexanthone (7), anomalin A (8), decarboxycitrinone (9) and 2,5-dimethyl-7-hydroxychromone (10). The structures of all isolated compounds were unambiguously elucidated based on extensive 1D and 2D NMR and HR-MS analyzes. The absolute configuration of arthrinins A-D (1-4) was established by the convenient Mosher method performed in NMR tubes and by interpretation of the ROESY spectra. Antiproliferative activity of the isolated compounds was assessed in vitro against four different tumor cell lines, including mouse lymphoma (L5178Y), human chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562), human ovarian cancer (A2780) and cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells (A2780CisR), using the MTT assay. Norlichexanthone (7) and anomalin A (8) exhibited the strongest activities with IC\u2085\u2080 values ranging from 0.40 to 74.0 \u03bcM depending on the cell line investigated. This was paralleled by the inhibitory activity of both compounds against 16 cancer related protein kinases including aurora-B, PIM1, and VEGF-R2. In vitro IC\u2085\u2080 values of 7 and 8 against these three protein kinases ranged from 0.3 to 11.7 \u03bcM. Further investigation of the potential antitumoral activity of compounds 5-8 was performed in an in vitro angiogenesis assay against human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) sprouting induced by vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Anomalin A (8), myrocin D (5) and myrocin A (6) inhibited VEGF-A dependent endothelial cell sprouting with IC\u2085\u2080 values of 1.8, 2.6 and 3.7 \u03bcM, respectively, whereas norlichexanthone (7) was inactive.",

We report herein on the use of both culture dependent and independent approaches for evaluation of soil microbial diversity in the rhizosphere of canola, a crop known to support a diverse microbiome, including plant growth promoting rhizobacteria. Initial screening of rhizosphere soils showed that microbial diversity, particularly bacterial, was greatest at crop maturity; therefore organismal recovery was attempted with soil collected at canola harvest. Two standard media (Mueller Hinton and gellan gum) were evaluated following inoculation with soil aqueous suspensions and compared with a novel \"rhizochip\" prototype buried in a living canola crop rhizosphere for microbial culture in situ. Following successful recovery and identification of 375 rhizosphere microbiota of interest from all culture methods, isolates were identified by Sanger sequencing and/or characterization using morphological and biochemical traits. Three bacterial isolates of interest were randomly selected as case studies for intensive metabolic profiling. After successful culture in liquid media and solvent extraction, individual extracts were subjected to evaluation by UHPLC-DAD-QToF-MS, resulting in the rapid characterization of metabolites of interest from cultures of two isolates. After evaluation of key molecular features, unique or unusual bacterial metabolites were annotated and are reported herein.",

      "title": "Activation of dormant secondary metabolite production by introducing neomycin resistance into the deep-sea fungus, Aspergillus versicolor ZBY-3.",
      "abstract": "A new ultrasound-mediated approach has been developed to introduce neomycin-resistance to activate silent pathways for secondary metabolite production in a bio-inactive, deep-sea fungus, Aspergillus versicolor ZBY-3. Upon treatment of the ZBY-3 spores with a high concentration of neomycin by proper ultrasound irradiation, a total of 30 mutants were obtained by single colony isolation. The acquired resistance of the mutants to neomycin was confirmed by a resistance test. In contrast to the ZBY-3 strain, the EtOAc extracts of 22 of the 30 mutants inhibited the human cancer K562 cells, indicating that these mutants acquired a capability to produce antitumor metabolites. HPLC-photodiode array detector (PDAD)-UV and HPLC-electron spray ionization (ESI)-MS analyses of the EtOAc extracts of seven bioactive mutants and the ZBY-3 strain indicated that diverse secondary metabolites have been newly produced in the mutant extracts in contrast to the ZBY-3 extract. The followed isolation and characterization demonstrated that six metabolites, cyclo(D-Pro-D-Phe) (1), cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Pro) (2), phenethyl 5-oxo-L-prolinate (3), cyclo(L-Ile-L-Pro) (4), cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro) (5) and 3\u03b2,5\u03b1,9\u03b1-trihydroxy-(22E,24R)-ergosta-7,22-dien-6-one (6), were newly produced by the mutant u2n2h3-3 compared to the parent ZBY-3 strain. Compound 3 was a new compound; 2 was isolated from a natural source for the first time, and all of these compounds were also not yet found in the metabolites of other A. versicolor strains. Compounds 1-6 inhibited the K562 cells, with inhibition rates of 54.6% (1), 72.9% (2), 23.5% (3), 29.6% (4), 30.9% (5) and 51.1% (6) at 100 \u03bcg/mL, and inhibited also other human cancer HL-60, BGC-823 and HeLa cells, to some extent. The present study demonstrated the effectiveness of the ultrasound-mediated approach to activate silent metabolite production in fungi by introducing acquired resistance to aminoglycosides and its potential for discovering new compounds from silent fungal metabolic pathways. This approach could be applied to elicit the metabolic potentials of other fungal isolates to discover new compounds from cryptic secondary metabolites.",

      "abstract": "Nine new meroterpenes (1-9) and one new dioxolanone derivative (10), along with seven known compounds (11-17), were isolated from solid cultures of the endophytic fungus Guignardia sp., obtained from Euphorbia sieboldiana. Their structures were elucidated by analysis of UV, IR, 1D and 2D NMR, and HRESIMS data, and their absolute configurations were determined by a combination of single-crystal X-ray studies, modified Mosher methods, and Rh2(OCOCF3)4- and Mo2(OCOCH3)4-induced electronic circular dichroism experiments. All compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects alone and with fluconazole on the growth and biofilms of Candida albicans. At 6.3 \u03bcg/mL combined with 0.031 \u03bcg/mL of fluconazole, compounds 8 and 16 were found to have prominent inhibition on the growth of C. albicans with fractional inhibitory concentration index values of 0.23 and 0.19, respectively. Combined with fluconazole, both of them (40 \u03bcg/mL for 8 and 20 \u03bcg/mL for 16) could also inhibit C. albicans biofilms and reverse the tolerance of C. albicans biofilms to fluconazole.",

      "title": "Direct Pathway Cloning (DiPaC) to unlock natural product biosynthetic potential.",
      "abstract": "Specialized metabolites from bacteria are an important source of inspiration for drug development. The genes required for the biosynthesis of such metabolites in bacteria are usually organized in so-called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Using modern bioinformatic tools, the wealth of genomic data can be scanned for such BGCs and the expected products can often structurally be predicted in silico. This facilitates the directed discovery of putatively novel bacterial metabolites. However, the production of these molecules often requires genetic manipulation of the BGC for activation or the expression of the pathway in a heterologous host. The latter necessitates the transplantation of the BGC into a suitable expression system. To achieve this goal, powerful cloning strategies based on in vivo homologous recombination have recently been developed. This includes LCHR and LLHR in E. coli as well as TAR cloning in yeast. Here, we present Direct Pathway Cloning (DiPaC) as an efficient complementary BGC capturing strategy that relies on long-amplicon PCR and in vitro DNA assembly. This straightforward approach facilitates full pathway assembly, BGC refactoring and direct transfer into any vector backbone in vitro. The broad applicability and efficiency of DiPaC is demonstrated by the discovery of a new phenazine from Serratia fonticola, the first heterologous production of anabaenopeptins from Nostoc punctiforme and the transfer of the native erythromycin BGC from Saccharopolyspora erythraea into Streptomyces. Due to its simplicity, we envisage DiPaC to become an essential method for BGC cloning and metabolic pathways construction with significant applications in metabolic engineering, synthetic biology and biotechnology.",

      "abstract": "A bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude methanol extract of the myxobacterium Hyalangium minutum, strain NOCB-2(T) (DSM 14724(T)), led to the isolation of hyaladione (1), a novel S-methyl cyclohexadiene-dione. The structure of 1 was established by HRESIMS, NMR, and IR spectroscopy as well as X-ray crystallography. Compound 1 was active against growing mammalian cell lines, with IC(50) values ranging from 1.23 to 3.93 \u03bcM, in addition to a broad spectrum of antibacterial and antifungal activities, including inhibition of pathogenic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with an MIC of 0.83 and 8.5 \u03bcg mL(-1), respectively.",

      "abstract": "Although biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have been discovered for hundreds of bacterial metabolites, our knowledge of their diversity remains limited. Here, we used a novel algorithm to systematically identify BGCs in the extensive extant microbial sequencing data. Network analysis of the predicted BGCs revealed large gene cluster families, the vast majority uncharacterized. We experimentally characterized the most prominent family, consisting of two subfamilies of hundreds of BGCs distributed throughout the Proteobacteria; their products are aryl polyenes, lipids with an aryl head group conjugated to a polyene tail. We identified a distant relationship to a third subfamily of aryl polyene BGCs, and together the three subfamilies represent the largest known family of biosynthetic gene clusters, with more than 1,000 members. Although these clusters are widely divergent in sequence, their small molecule products are remarkably conserved, indicating for the first time the important roles these compounds play in Gram-negative cell biology.",

      "abstract": "Chemical investigation of a marine-derived fungus, Penicillium steckii 108YD142, resulted in the discovery of a new tanzawaic acid derivative, tanzawaic acid Q (1), together with four known analogues, tanzawaic acids A (2), C (3), D (4), and K (5). The structures of tanzawaic acid derivatives 1-5 were determined by the detailed analysis of 1D, 2D NMR and LC-MS data, along with chemical methods and literature data analysis. These compounds significantly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production and the new tanzawaic acid Q (1) inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) proteins and mRNA expressions in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Additionally, compound 1 reduced the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrated that the new tanzawaic acid derivative inhibits LPS-induced inflammation. This is the first report on the anti-inflammatory activity of tanzawaic acid Q (1).",

      "abstract": "The antagonistic fungus Simplicillium lamellicola BCP has been developed as a microbial biopesticide that effectively controls the development of various plant diseases caused by both pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic fungi. Antibacterial bioassay-directed fractionation was used to isolate mannosyl lipids from S. lamellicola BCP, and the structures of these compounds were elucidated using spectral analysis and chemical degradation. Three novel mannosyl lipids were characterized and identified as halymecins F and G and (3R,5R)-3-O-\u03b2-D-mannosyl-3,5-dihydrodecanoic acid. Massoia lactone and (3R, 5R)-3-hydroxydecan-5-olide were also isolated from S. lamellicola BCP. The three novel compounds inhibited the growth of the majority of phytopathogenic bacteria that were tested, and halymecin F displayed the strongest antibacterial activity. Agrobacterium tumefaciens was the most sensitive to the three novel compounds, with IC\u2085\u2080 values ranging from 1.58 to 24.8 \u03bcg/mL. The ethyl acetate extract of the fermentation broth from the antagonistic fungus effectively reduced the bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum on tomato seedlings. These results indicate that S. lamellicola BCP suppresses the development of plant bacterial diseases through the production of antibacterial metabolites.",

      "abstract": "The histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of p300 is essential for androgen receptor (AR) function. Androgen-independent prostate cancer cells require AR-mediated transcriptional activation for their growth. These observations indicate that p300 HAT is a promising target to overcome such hormone-resistant cancer cells. We sought p300 HAT inhibitors among microbial metabolites. By culturing a production strain belonging to Penicillium, we identified two new compounds, NK13650A and NK13650B, which were obtained as specific p300 HAT inhibitors. Structural analyses of these compounds elucidated that NK13650s have novel chemical structures comprising several amino acids and citrate. We applied a newly developed biosynthesis-based method to reveal the absolute configuration at the citrate quaternary carbon. This was accomplished by feeding a (13)C-labeled biosynthetic precursor of citrate. NK13650s selectively inhibited the activity of p300 HAT but not that of Tip60 HAT. NK13650s showed inhibitory activity against agonist-induced AR transcriptional activation, and NK13650A treatment inhibited hormone-dependent and -independent growth of prostate cancer cells.",
