D-1, previously found to produce a variety of cytotoxic cyclopropyl-fused and cyclobutyl-fused pimarane diterpenoids when grown in the defined medium, was induced to produce unusual metabolites by growing on solid rice medium. A chemical investigation on the rice medium extract led to the isolation of four new meroterpenoids, eutypellacytosporins A-D (1-4), along with the known biogenetically related compound cytosporin D (5). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by their detailed spectroscopic analysis and modified Mosher's method. Compounds 1-4 may be formed by the 12,32-ester linkage of two moieties, cytosporin D (5) and decipienolide A or B. All isolated compounds, except 5, showed weak cytotoxicity against DU145, SW1990, Huh7, and PANC-1 cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 4.9 to 17.1 Î¼M.","['Eutypellacytosporin B', 'Eutypellacytosporin A', 'Eutypellacytosporin C', 'Eutypellacytosporin D']",4,"['Eutypellacytosporin D', 'Eutypellacytosporin B', 'Eutypellacytosporin A', 'Decipienolide A', 'Eutypellacytosporin C', 'Cytosporin D']",6
